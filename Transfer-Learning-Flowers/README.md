# Flower Species Classification (Transfer Learning)

## Project Overview
This project uses Transfer Learning with a pretrained MobileNetV2 model to classify images of flowers into 5 different species.

## Dataset
TensorFlow Flowers Dataset

## Model
- MobileNetV2 (Pretrained)
- 5-Class Classification
- Some layers frozen for faster training

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Goal
To accurately classify flower images into Daisy, Dandelion, Rose, Sunflower, and Tulip.
